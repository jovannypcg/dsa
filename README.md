# DSA Study Repository

A personal Java repository for studying Data Structures & Algorithms in preparation for software engineering interviews. Each problem is self-contained, test-driven, and reviewed with complexity analysis.

## Stack

- **Language**: Java 17
- **Build**: Maven 3.9.16
- **Tests**: JUnit 5 + AssertJ

## Prerequisites

Install [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/):

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Install Java 17 and Maven 3.9.16 via SDKMAN:

```bash
sdk install java 17.0.19-tem
sdk install maven 3.9.16
```

### Problem package naming

Problems are numbered in the order they were attempted, using a zero-padded prefix and a `p` to keep the package name a valid Java identifier:

```
mx.jovannypcg.base.p01_twosum
mx.jovannypcg.base.p02_validanagram
...
```

### Files per problem

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Solution.java` | Stub with Javadoc. You implement the method body. |
| `README.md` | Problem statement, I/O examples, constraints, and progressive hints. |
| `SolutionTest.java` | Exhaustive JUnit 5 tests covering happy path, edge cases, and constraint boundaries. |
| `REVIEW.md` | Generated when you type **"Done"** (after `SolutionTest` passes). Contains complexity analysis of your solution, the optimal approach, alternative approaches, and an algorithm trace for each. |
| `SOLUTION.md` | Generated when you type **"Give up"**. Contains all approaches ordered from most to least optimal, each with explanation, complexity, Java code, and an algorithm trace. Claude also implements the optimal solution in `Solution.java` and confirms tests pass. |

## Learning Guides (`./docs`)

- `docs/coding-patterns/` — one Markdown file per DSA pattern category, each with:
  - How to recognize the pattern
  - Step-by-step approach
  - Java code template
  - Up to 20 curated practice problems (LeetCode / NeetCode links)
- `docs/design-patterns/` — creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns, one Markdown file per pattern.

Read the relevant guide before starting a problem to prime your thinking on the pattern.

## Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run tests for a specific problem:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest="SolutionTest" -pl .
```

## Adding a New Exercise with Claude

Paste the problem description (or a link to it) and tell Claude to set it up:

```
Set up the next exercise: <problem name or description>
Source: <URL>  ← optional but recommended
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Determine the next index by inspecting existing packages.
2. Create `Solution.java` with the method stub and Javadoc.
3. Create `README.md` with the problem description, examples, constraints, and hints.
4. Create `SolutionTest.java` with an exhaustive test suite aligned to the constraints.

When you finish implementing `Solution.java`, type:

- **`Done`** → Claude runs `SolutionTest` (must pass), then writes `REVIEW.md` with complexity analysis, the optimal approach, alternatives, and an algorithm trace for each.
- **`Give up`** → Claude writes `SOLUTION.md` with all approaches explained (ordered from most to least optimal, each with an algorithm trace), implements the optimal solution in `Solution.java`, and confirms tests pass.
